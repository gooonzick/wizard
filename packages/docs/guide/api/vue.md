# Vue Package (`@gooonzick/wizard-vue`)

::: warning Coming Soon
Vue integration is not yet implemented. This package is planned for a future release.

If you're interested in contributing to the Vue integration, please check out the [CI/CD](/guide/ci-cd) guide for more information.

## Planned API

The Vue integration will provide similar functionality to the React package, with Vue-specific APIs:

- `useWizard()` composable for Vue 3
- `WizardProvider` component for context sharing
- Fine-grained composables for selective reactivity
- Full TypeScript support
